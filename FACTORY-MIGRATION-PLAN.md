## Timeline Estimate

**Total Duration: 3-4 weeks**

- **Week 1**: Phases 1-3 (Setup, Core Dependencies, Domain Layer)
- **Week 2**: Phases 4-5 (Presentation Layer, SwiftUI Integration)
- **Week 3**: Phases 6-8 (Testing, Build Config, Legacy Removal)
- **Week 4**: Phases 9-10 (Documentation, Final Testing, Validation)

## Notes

- Each checkbox represents a discrete, testable task
- Tasks should be completed in order within each phase
- Some tasks may be done in parallel within the same phase
- Create separate branches for each major phase if desired
- Document any deviations from this plan as they occur
