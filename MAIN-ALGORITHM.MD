# Ritualist Personality Analysis Algorithm

## Overview

Ritualist uses a sophisticated Big Five personality analysis system that examines user habit patterns to determine their dominant personality trait. The algorithm combines multiple data sources, applies weighted personality coefficients, and uses an advanced multi-criteria tie-breaking system to provide accurate and consistent results.

## Core Algorithm Architecture

### 1. Data Collection Phase

The algorithm analyzes the following data sources:

- **Active Habits**: Current user habits across all categories
- **Habit Categories**: Both predefined (Health, Wellness, Productivity, Learning, Social) and custom user-created categories
- **Completion Rates**: Historical habit completion percentages
- **Selected Suggestions**: Personality-weighted habit suggestions chosen by the user
- **Custom Habits**: User-created habits with inferred behavioral patterns

### 2. Personality Weight System

#### Predefined Category Weights

Each predefined category has scientifically-informed personality weights:

**Health Category:**
- Conscientiousness: +0.6 (disciplined health routines)
- Neuroticism: -0.3 (stress management, lower anxiety)
- Agreeableness: +0.2 (self-care affects relationships)

**Wellness Category:**
- Conscientiousness: +0.4 (regular wellness practices)
- Neuroticism: -0.5 (stress reduction, emotional stability)
- Openness: +0.3 (openness to new wellness practices)
- Agreeableness: +0.2 (mindfulness affects empathy)

**Productivity Category:**
- Conscientiousness: +0.8 (high organization and discipline)
- Neuroticism: -0.2 (confidence in systems)
- Openness: +0.1 (trying new productivity methods)

**Learning Category:**
- Openness: +0.7 (high curiosity and learning)
- Conscientiousness: +0.4 (disciplined study habits)
- Extraversion: -0.1 (preference for quiet study)

**Social Category:**
- Extraversion: +0.8 (high social engagement)
- Agreeableness: +0.5 (cooperative and friendly)
- Openness: +0.2 (open to new social experiences)
- Neuroticism: -0.2 (comfortable in social settings)

#### Custom Category Inference

For custom categories without explicit weights, the algorithm infers personality traits through behavioral pattern analysis:

**Baseline Weights**: All traits start with +0.05 to prevent complete zeroing

**Behavioral Inference Rules:**
- **High Consistency (>70% completion)**: Conscientiousness +0.3
- **Low Consistency (<30% completion)**: Neuroticism +0.2
- **Social Keywords** ("social", "friend", "meet", "call", "visit"): Extraversion +0.4
- **Habit Variety** (3+ unique habit types): Openness +0.25
- **Care Keywords** ("love", "care", "help", "family", "relationship"): Agreeableness +0.5

### 3. Score Calculation Process

#### Accumulation Phase

For each personality trait, the algorithm accumulates weighted evidence:

1. **Suggestion Analysis**: Processes selected habit suggestions with their predefined personality weights
2. **Category Analysis**: 
   - Uses explicit weights for predefined categories
   - Applies inferred weights for custom categories
   - Scales contribution by category importance (number of habits in category)
3. **Behavioral Bonuses**:
   - **Completion Rate Bonus**: (avgCompletionRate - 0.5) × 0.3 → Conscientiousness
   - **Diversity Bonus**: min(categoryCount / 10.0, 1.0) × 0.2 → Openness
   - **Social Habit Bonus**: socialHabitRatio × 0.25 → Extraversion

#### Normalization Phase

Raw accumulated scores are normalized to 0.0-1.0 range:

```
normalizedScore = (accumulator / totalWeight + 1.0) / 2.0
```

This converts the -1 to +1 range to a 0 to 1 probability range.

### 4. Dominant Trait Selection

#### Primary Selection

The trait with the highest normalized score is selected as dominant.

#### Advanced Tie-Breaking System

When multiple traits have identical normalized scores, a sophisticated multi-criteria system breaks ties:

##### Criteria 1: Raw Accumulator Precision (40% weight)
- Uses unrounded raw calculation values
- Provides maximum mathematical precision
- Often reveals subtle differences masked by normalization

##### Criteria 2: Evidence Diversity (30% weight)
- Counts distinct data sources supporting each trait
- Sources include:
  - Predefined categories with explicit weights
  - Custom categories with habits
  - Behavioral pattern bonuses (completion, diversity, social patterns)
- Higher source diversity indicates more reliable trait evidence

##### Criteria 3: Trait Stability Preference (20% weight)
- Applies psychological research on trait stability
- Stability weights:
  - Conscientiousness: 0.9 (most stable, directly habit-related)
  - Openness: 0.8 (stable intellectual trait)
  - Neuroticism: 0.7 (moderate emotional stability)
  - Agreeableness: 0.6 (context-dependent social trait)
  - Extraversion: 0.5 (most situational trait)

##### Criteria 4: Data Recency Bonus (10% weight)
- Small bonus for traits with most current data
- Currently: Conscientiousness gets +0.1 (completion data is most recent)
- Ensures dynamic traits aren't overlooked

#### Final Scoring Formula

```
tieBreakScore = (rawScore × 0.4) + (diversityScore × 0.3) + (stabilityWeight × 0.2) + (recencyBonus × 0.1)
```

The trait with the highest tie-break score wins.

### 5. Confidence Calculation

Confidence levels are determined by the amount of data analyzed:

- **High**: 150+ data points (extensive habit tracking)
- **Medium**: 50-149 data points (moderate tracking)
- **Low**: <50 data points (limited data)
- **Insufficient**: Edge case handling

## Algorithm Strengths

### 1. **Deterministic Consistency**
- Eliminates fluctuations through stable dictionary handling
- Multi-criteria tie-breaking prevents arbitrary winner selection
- Reproducible results for identical input data

### 2. **Psychological Validity**
- Based on established Big Five personality research
- Weights reflect real psychological correlations
- Stability preferences align with trait theory

### 3. **Data-Driven Intelligence**
- Multiple evidence sources provide robust analysis
- Behavioral inference handles incomplete data
- Evidence diversity prevents over-reliance on single patterns

### 4. **Scalable Architecture**
- Handles both predefined and custom categories
- Graceful degradation with limited data
- Extensible for new personality models

### 5. **User-Centric Design**
- Accounts for individual habit creation patterns
- Balances explicit and inferred preferences
- Provides meaningful confidence indicators
