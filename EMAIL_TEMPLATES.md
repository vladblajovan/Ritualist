### Question About Location Privacy

```
Subject: Re: Location Privacy Question - Ritualist

Dear [User Name],

Great question! Location privacy is important to us.

HOW LOCATION WORKS IN RITUALIST:

1. Permission Request
   - When you first use geofencing, Ritualist asks for location permission
   - You can choose: "Allow Once," "Allow While Using App," or "Don't Allow"
   - You can change this anytime in Settings > Privacy > Location Services

2. Location Usage
   - Location is used only to detect when you enter/exit a geofence
   - Geofencing triggers a local reminder notification
   - This all happens on your device

3. Location Privacy
   - Your location coordinates are NEVER sent to Ritualist servers
   - Your location is NOT shared with third parties
   - Your location is NOT used for advertising or tracking
   - Location data is stored on your device and iCloud only

4. Your Control
   - Disable location: Settings > Privacy > Location Services > Ritualist > Never
   - Disable geofencing: Ritualist Settings > Location > Toggle OFF
   - You can revoke access anytime

IMPORTANT NOTE:
If you disable location, geofencing won't work, but all other app features
will function normally.

For more details, see our Privacy Policy Section 7:
https://ritualist.app/privacy#location

Does this answer your question? Feel free to ask follow-ups!
