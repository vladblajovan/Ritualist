        // Linguistic tagging
        let tagger = NLTagger(tagSchemes: [.lexicalClass, .nameType])
        tagger.string = text
        
        var traitWeights: [PersonalityTrait: Double] = [:]
        
        // Extract personality indicators
        tagger.enumerateTags(in: text.startIndex..<text.endIndex, 
                           unit: .word, 
                           scheme: .lexicalClass) { tag, tokenRange in
            let word = String(text[tokenRange]).lowercased()
            
            // Analyze for personality traits
            if opennessKeywords.contains(word) {
                traitWeights[.openness, default: 0.0] += 0.2
            }
            // ... other trait analysis
            
            return true
        }
