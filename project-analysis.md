## Project Overview

Ritualist is an iOS habit tracking application built with SwiftUI and following Clean Architecture principles. The project is structured as a multi-target application consisting of:

- Main iOS App
- RitualistCore Framework (SPM Package)
- Widget Extension
- Planned Watch App Support

### Key Features
- Habit tracking with multiple types (binary, numeric)
- Customizable schedules (daily, weekly, custom)
- Streak calculation and tracking
- Rich notifications system
- Interactive widgets
- Data persistence using SwiftData
- Personality analysis
- Deep linking support

## Architecture Analysis

### Strengths

1. **Clean Architecture Implementation**
   - Clear separation of concerns with RitualistCore containing domain layer
   - Well-defined use case protocols
   - Proper dependency injection using Factory pattern
   - Clear repository interfaces

2. **Modern iOS Technologies**
   - SwiftUI for UI layer
   - SwiftData for persistence
   - WidgetKit integration
   - Async/await adoption

### Inconsistencies

1. **Observable Pattern Usage**
   - Mixed usage of property wrappers
   - Some ViewModels not properly utilizing @Observable
   - Inconsistent state management patterns

2. **Use Case Implementation**
   - **Critical Issue**: ViewModels directly inject Services, bypassing UseCase layer entirely
   - **Concrete Examples**: 
     - `HabitsViewModel` → `@Injected(\.habitCompletionService)`
     - `OverviewViewModel` → `@Injected(\.slogansService)`, `userService`
     - `SettingsViewModel` → `@Injected(\.paywallService)`
   - **Root Cause**: Unclear distinction between UseCases (business operations) vs Services (utilities)
   - Some use cases performing repository operations directly in views
   - Inconsistent error handling patterns
   - Some business logic leaked into ViewModels

3. **Service Layer**
   - **Architecture Violation**: ViewModels directly inject Services, violating Clean Architecture
   - **Missing Layer**: No clear UseCase layer orchestrating Services and Repositories
   - **Responsibility Confusion**:
     - Services performing business operations (should be UseCases)
     - UseCases performing simple calculations (should be Services)
   - **Protocol Boundaries**: Inconsistent use of protocols for abstraction
   - **Impact on Testability**: Direct Service injection makes ViewModels hard to test
   - Some services containing presentation logic
   - **Correct Flow Should Be**: Views → ViewModels → UseCases → [Services + Repositories]

## Feature Implementation Review

### Well-Implemented Features

1. **Core Habit Tracking**
   - Clean domain models
   - Strong validation logic
   - Proper separation of concerns

2. **Widget Integration**
   - Shared business logic through RitualistCore
   - Clean data access patterns
   - Proper deep linking implementation

3. **Notifications**
   - Centralized notification service
   - Clear scheduling patterns
   - Good error handling

### Areas Needing Improvement

1. **Data Flow**
   - Some ViewModels bypass use cases
   - Direct repository access in views
   - Inconsistent state management

2. **Business Logic Location**
   - Some business rules in ViewModels
   - Validation logic scattered across layers
   - Duplicate logic between main app and widget

## Testing Strategy Assessment

### Current State

1. **Over-reliance on Mocks**
   - Tests primarily verify mock behavior rather than actual implementations
   - Critical services (HabitCompletionService, etc.) tested through mocks
   - Real implementations often untested

2. **Missing Test Coverage**
   - No repository implementation tests
   - Limited integration tests
   - No SwiftData interaction tests
   - Missing edge case coverage

3. **Test Organization**
   - Unclear test boundaries
   - Inconsistent use of test doubles
   - Poor separation of unit and integration tests

### Recommendations

1. **Testing Architecture Overhaul**
   - Implement behavior-driven testing
   - Use real implementations where possible
   - Create comprehensive integration tests
   - Establish clear test double strategy

2. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Implement in-memory database testing
   - Create robust test data builders
   - Establish clear test patterns
   - Improve CI/CD integration

3. **Coverage Goals**
   - Domain Layer: 90%+
   - Data Layer: 85%+
   - Presentation Layer: 70%+
   - Overall: 80%+

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **UseCase vs Service Layer Clarification (CRITICAL)**
   - **Define Clear Boundaries**: 
     - UseCases = Single business operations (CompleteHabitUseCase)
     - Services = Reusable utilities/calculations (HabitCompletionCalculator)
   - **Refactor ViewModel Dependencies**: Remove all @Injected Services, replace with UseCases
   - **Create Missing UseCases**: For every ViewModel business operation
   - **Rename Confusing Services**: HabitCompletionService → HabitCompletionCalculator
   - **Enforce Protocol Boundaries**: All UseCases protocol-based in RitualistCore

2. **Architecture Consistency**
   - Enforce use case pattern consistently
   - Remove direct repository access from views
   - Establish clear service boundaries
   - Implement consistent @Observable pattern usage

3. **Testing Improvements**
   - Replace mock-based tests with real implementation tests
   - Implement repository test suite
   - Create integration test suite
   - Establish clear test double guidelines

4. **Code Organization**
   - Consolidate business logic in RitualistCore
   - Clean up ViewModel responsibilities
   - Strengthen service layer boundaries
   - Improve error handling patterns

### Long-term Goals

1. **Technical Debt**
   - Complete RitualistCore migration
   - Implement comprehensive test coverage
   - Strengthen widget architecture
   - Prepare for watch app implementation

2. **Architecture Evolution**
   - Further modularization
   - Improved state management
   - Enhanced testing infrastructure
   - Stronger validation patterns

This analysis reveals a solid foundation with some architectural inconsistencies and testing gaps. The project would benefit from stricter adherence to clean architecture principles and a more robust testing strategy focusing on real implementations rather than mock-based testing.
