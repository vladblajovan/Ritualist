## Data Threshold Requirements

### Minimum Data Requirements for Personality Analysis
The personality analysis requires sufficient user data to provide meaningful and accurate results. Users must meet ALL of the following criteria:

#### Core Activity Thresholds
- [x] **Minimum 5 active habits**: User must have at least 5 currently active habits
- [x] **1 complete week of logging**: At least 7 consecutive days of habit logging activity
- [x] **3 custom categories**: User must have created at least 3 custom categories
- [x] **3 custom habits**: User must have created at least 3 custom habits (not from suggestions)

#### Advanced Data Quality Thresholds
- [x] **Habit diversity**: Habits must span at least 3 different categories
- [x] **Logging consistency**: At least 30% completion rate across all habits over the tracking period (implemented)
- [ ] **Temporal coverage**: Data must span at least 14 days total (can be non-consecutive)
- [ ] **Engagement depth**: At least 2 numeric habits with target tracking
- [ ] **Behavioral variety**: Mix of daily and weekly scheduled habits

### DataThresholdValidator Implementation
```swift
public struct DataThresholdValidator {
    public func validateAnalysisEligibility(
        habits: [Habit],
        habitLogs: [HabitLog],
        categories: [Category]
    ) -> AnalysisEligibility
    
    public func getProgressTowardsEligibility(
        habits: [Habit],
        habitLogs: [HabitLog],
        categories: [Category]
    ) -> ThresholdProgress
}

public struct AnalysisEligibility {
    public let isEligible: Bool
    public let missingRequirements: [ThresholdRequirement]
    public let confidenceLevel: ConfidenceLevel
}

public struct ThresholdProgress {
    public let activeHabits: ProgressStatus // 3/5 habits
    public let loggingDays: ProgressStatus // 4/7 days
    public let customCategories: ProgressStatus // 1/3 categories
    public let customHabits: ProgressStatus // 2/3 habits
    public let overallProgress: Double // 0.0-1.0
}
```

### Confidence Levels Based on Data Quality
- **High Confidence (90%+)**: Exceeds all minimum thresholds by 50%+
- **Medium Confidence (70-89%)**: Meets all minimum thresholds
- **Low Confidence (50-69%)**: Meets minimum thresholds but limited data variety
- **Insufficient Data (<50%)**: Does not meet minimum requirements

### User Experience for Insufficient Data
- [x] **Progress Dashboard**: Visual progress toward meeting each threshold
- [x] **Actionable Guidance**: Specific suggestions to meet requirements
- [x] **Estimated Timeline**: When analysis will become available
- [x] **Encouragement Messaging**: Motivating users to build tracking habits
