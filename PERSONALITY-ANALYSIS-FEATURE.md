## Data Threshold Requirements

### Minimum Data Requirements for Personality Analysis
The personality analysis requires sufficient user data to provide meaningful and accurate results. Users must meet ALL of the following criteria:

#### Core Activity Thresholds
- [x] **Minimum 5 active habits**: User must have at least 5 currently active habits
- [x] **1 complete week of logging**: At least 7 consecutive days of habit logging activity
- [x] **3 custom categories**: User must have created at least 3 custom categories
- [x] **3 custom habits**: User must have created at least 3 custom habits (not from suggestions)

#### Advanced Data Quality Thresholds
- [x] **Habit diversity**: Habits must span at least 3 different categories
- [x] **Logging consistency**: At least 30% completion rate across all habits over the tracking period (implemented)
- [ ] **Temporal coverage**: Data must span at least 14 days total (can be non-consecutive)
- [ ] **Engagement depth**: At least 2 numeric habits with target tracking
- [ ] **Behavioral variety**: Mix of daily and weekly scheduled habits

### DataThresholdValidator Implementation
```swift
public struct DataThresholdValidator {
    public func validateAnalysisEligibility(
        habits: [Habit],
        habitLogs: [HabitLog],
        categories: [Category]
    ) -> AnalysisEligibility
    
    public func getProgressTowardsEligibility(
        habits: [Habit],
        habitLogs: [HabitLog],
        categories: [Category]
    ) -> ThresholdProgress
}

public struct AnalysisEligibility {
    public let isEligible: Bool
    public let missingRequirements: [ThresholdRequirement]
    public let confidenceLevel: ConfidenceLevel
}

public struct ThresholdProgress {
    public let activeHabits: ProgressStatus // 3/5 habits
    public let loggingDays: ProgressStatus // 4/7 days
    public let customCategories: ProgressStatus // 1/3 categories
    public let customHabits: ProgressStatus // 2/3 habits
    public let overallProgress: Double // 0.0-1.0
}
```

### Confidence Levels Based on Data Quality

## Analysis Coefficients Framework

### Habit Categories and Personality Weights
```swift
// Example coefficient mappings
"Health/Exercise": [
    .conscientiousness: 0.7,
    .neuroticism: -0.4,
    .extraversion: 0.3
]

"Creativity/Art": [
    .openness: 0.8,
    .conscientiousness: 0.4,
    .neuroticism: -0.2
]

"Social/Relationships": [
    .extraversion: 0.8,
    .agreeableness: 0.7,
    .openness: 0.3
]

"Learning/Education": [
    .openness: 0.9,
    .conscientiousness: 0.6,
    .neuroticism: -0.1
]
```

### Behavioral Pattern Weights
- **Schedule-Aware Completion Rate**: High schedule adherence = +Conscientiousness (0.4 weight, enhanced)
- **Cross-Habit Consistency**: >50% completion across habits = +Conscientiousness (0.2 weight, new)
- **Emotional Stability Patterns**: High completion (>70%) = -Neuroticism, Low completion (<30%) = +Neuroticism (new)
- **Schedule Flexibility Preference**: Flexible schedules = +Openness (0.25 weight, new)
- **Individual Habit Performance**: 0.3-1.0 weighting based on completion rate (implemented)
- **Habit Variety**: Many different types = +Openness
- **Social Focus**: Group activities = +Extraversion, +Agreeableness
- **Stress Management**: Meditation/relaxation = -Neuroticism
- **Goal Complexity**: Detailed tracking = +Conscientiousness
- **Custom Creation**: Unique habits = +Openness
- **Recovery Patterns**: Quick bouncebacks = -Neuroticism
- **Habit-Specific Modifiers**: Keywords and patterns influence trait attribution (implemented)

### Completion Rate Weighting Algorithm (IMPLEMENTED)
The personality analysis now incorporates individual habit performance to provide more psychologically accurate results:

```swift
// Completion-based weighting (0.3 to 1.0 range)
let completionWeighting = 0.3 + (completionRate * 0.7)

// Combined weighting calculation
let modifiedWeight = categoryWeight * habitModifier * completionWeighting
```

**Key Benefits:**
- **Psychological Accuracy**: Habits with 0% completion get reduced impact (0.3x weight)
- **Performance Distinction**: Habits with 100% completion get full impact (1.0x weight)
- **Realistic Scoring**: Personality traits now reflect actual behavior vs stated intentions
- **Individual Focus**: Each habit's completion rate is analyzed independently

**Algorithm Details:**
- **Minimum Weight**: 0.3 (30% of category weight for never-completed habits)
- **Maximum Weight**: 1.0 (100% of category weight for always-completed habits)
- **Linear Scaling**: Completion rate directly influences personality impact
- **Data Source**: Individual habit completion rates from tracking history

### Enhanced Schedule-Aware Analysis (v1.1 - NEW)
The latest algorithm version incorporates sophisticated schedule-awareness and completion pattern analysis:

#### Schedule-Aware Completion Statistics
```swift
// Uses getHabitCompletionStats for precise completion analysis
let completionStats = getHabitCompletionStats(for: userId, from: startDate, to: endDate)

// Enhanced conscientiousness calculation
let scheduleAwareRate = stats.completionRate // Respects habit schedules
let consistencyRatio = Double(stats.completedHabits) / Double(stats.totalHabits)
let conscientiousnessScore = (scheduleAwareRate - 0.5) * 0.4 + (consistencyRatio - 0.5) * 0.2
```

#### Multi-Trait Integration
- **Conscientiousness**: Schedule adherence (0.4) + cross-habit consistency (0.2) = 0.6 total weight
- **Neuroticism**: Emotional stability inference from completion patterns (±0.2-0.3 weight)
- **Openness**: Schedule flexibility preference analysis (0.25 additional weight)
- **Confidence**: Quality-based adjustments with up to +45 bonus points

#### Psychological Accuracy Improvements
- **Expected vs Actual**: Only counts days when habit was actually scheduled
- **Habit Lifecycle**: Respects habit start/end dates for accurate analysis
- **Schedule Types**: Differentiates daily, specific days, and flexible frequency patterns
- **Individual Performance**: Each habit's completion rate influences its personality impact
